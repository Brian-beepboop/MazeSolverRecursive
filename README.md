# MazeSolverRecursive
A maze made from book problem that has a creature that will go through a maze
maze is a rectanulararray the x are walls 
using recurion you will mark each path that was walked. until cleared 

we have multiple files to use for a make file. 

there probably is a simpler way to do this without so many files like making a 2d array in your main instead, will invest into searching this later

Please Enjoy!
